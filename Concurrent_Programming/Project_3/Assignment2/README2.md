Compile with `gcc` or use `clang` for compilation.

An example compilation command is:

1. `gcc -Wall -g ask2.c -o ask2`

2. `./ask2 (n of workers) (print option 1 or 0)` <input>


To find how many primes are there using `test.c`:

1. gcc -Wall -g test.c -o test
2. ./ask2 <inp.txt > out.txt
3. ./test <out.txt

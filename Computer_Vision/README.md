## 🖼️ Assignment 1: Basic Operations & Filtering

This assignment focuses on manual implementation of core image processing functions without relying on high-level built-in filtering libraries.

### Key Tasks
* **Grayscale Conversion**
* **Histogram Analysis**
* **Binarization**
* **Noise Reduction**: 
  * Comparing **Gaussian filters** vs. **Box filters** for White Gaussian Noise.
  * Comparing **Gaussian filters** vs. **Median filters** for Salt and Pepper noise.
* **Evaluation**: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

## 🔍 Assignment 2: Edge Detection Techniques

The second assignment explores advanced edge detection by comparing manual spatial operators against frequency-domain techniques.

### 1. Spatial Domain Edge Detection
Implementations for the following operators:
* **Sobel & Prewitt**
* **Laplacian**
* **Canny (OpenCV)**
* **Smoothing Impact**

### 2. Frequency Domain Edge Detection
* **FFT High-Pass Filtering**
* **Cutoff Analysis**
* **Spectrum Visualization**

### 3. Quantitative Evaluation
A comparison table is generated for each detector based on **Edge Density**:

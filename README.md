### 🛠 Hardware & Embedded Systems

* [**Embedded Systems**](./Embedded_Systems)
    * Developed on the **ZedBoard** platform (ARM Cortex + FPGA).
    * Designed hardware, bare-metal software and OpenCL Drivers using **Vivado, Vitis, Vitis HLS,** and **PetaLinux**.
* [**Digital Systems Lab**](./Digital_Systems_Lab)
    * Worked on the **Nexys A7-100T FPGA**.
    * Designed and tested hardware implementations for **Seven-Segment Displays, UART,** and **VGA drivers**.
    * Implemented an **SPI Master module** to interface with the built-in **ADXL335 accelerometer**.
* [**Microprocessor Design**](./Microprocessor_Design)
    * Designed and implemented a hardware-level **Single-Path Delay Radix-2 FFT Core**.

### 💻 Systems & Parallel Programming

* [**High-Performance Computing (HPC)**](./HPC)
    * Optimized sequential and parallel code for CPUs.
    * Optimized highly parallel algorithms for the **NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU**.
* [**Concurrent Programming**](./Concurrent_Programming)
    * Explored thread synchronization using **Mutexes and Semaphores**.
    * Implemented custom semaphores, a **thread scheduler**, and solved classic concurrency challenges like the **Narrow Bridge Problem**.
* [**Operating Systems**](./Operating_Systems)
    * Implemented core system modules, including **schedulers, memory handlers, and file systems**.
    * Gained in-depth knowledge of Virtual Memory, Memory Managment, Schedulers, filesystems and Disk operations.

### 🤖 IoT & Computer Vision

* [**Fire Detection System**](./Fire_Detection)
    * Built a human/fire detection system using the **Raspberry Pi 4** platform.
    * Utilized **YOLO Nano** for human detection and a custom-trained **CNN** for fire detection.
    * Used the **MQTT protocol** for data transfer between the Raspberry Pi and the main computing unit.
